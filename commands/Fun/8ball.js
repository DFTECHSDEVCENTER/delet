        SUBMITTING OUTCOMES
        If you wish to submit an outcome, please fork this repository, add the outcome to the "outcomes" array, and
        create a pull request. Please add a comment next to it, stating whether it is positive, negative, or neutral.
        If you're unsure, leave it blank. If you do state if it's positive, neutral or negative, please update the
        "OUTCOME TYPES" comments accordingly. 
        
        Please ensure your outcome has an "opposite" outcome to it too, so the number of positive and negative outcomes
        match. Unlike a regular magic 8 ball, delet's one has an equal number of positive and negative outcomes.

        OUTCOME TYPES:
        Positive: 14
        Neutral:  7
        Negative: 14
