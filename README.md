<p align="center"><strong>delet is a powerful, configurable and multipurpose Discord bot, made using the Discord.js library for the Discord API.
<br>Please ensure you read the section regarding self-hosting and portability in this README document.</strong></p>

## Commands
A variety of commands can be found in delet, ranging from system functions to fun commands. delet currently has over 100 commands, with many more planned for future releases.

## Music
delet boasts an advanced music system, with commands and features to make your listening experience as enjoyable as possible, through having a system that's easy to use, yet full of useful functions, such as a built-in YouTube search function, to avoid having to always find the song's YouTube link, as well as a full queueing system.

## Moderation
delet comes with a full moderation system, with even more features currently being developed. The moderation system of this version of delet will have the same moderation commands as the old version of delet, in addition to brand new, useful moderation commands. Both the new and existing commands will be written to be much more efficient and easy to use, as well as making them less error-prone.

## Translations
Basic support for using delet in other languages (locales) has been added into some parts of the bot, but not throughout, and such support will only be fully implemented if there is enough demand for translations to be added once delet has been publicly released. Should there be enough demand, our team of translators will start translating the [base locale file](https://github.com/DS-Development/delet/blob/master/locales/en-GB.js) (once complete) into their chosen language. If you'd like to sign up to be a translator, you may do so at [delet.js.org/go/translate](https://delet.js.org/go/translate).

## Open-Source
We're big fans of open-source here at DS Development. delet is an open-source project; which is why it can be found here, on GitHub. It is licensed under the GPL-3.0 license. This bot is open source for the reason of allowing others view its code and learn from it, and also to gain inspiration for their own ideas. However, please do not directly copy entire chunks of code, as it may not work with your bot.
For further information regarding permissions, limitations and conditions of this project, please see the [LICENSE](https://github.com/DS-Development/delet/blob/master/LICENSE) file.

## Self-Hosting
**We currently do not support self-hosting delet.** This is due to the reason that it wasn't initially built for the purpose of being self-hostable, and also depends on various things (such as configs, settings databases, etc.) in order to be fully functional, which instructions for setting up are not stated here. Furthermore, delet is still in-development, meaning some things may not work, and many things will be changing quite often, thus not being very suitable for self-hosting. Essentially, this project is open-source for educational purposes; so that people who are interested can see how everything works.

Full support for self-hosting may be added in a future update, if there is enough demand for it.
Obviously, you *are* free to clone this repository, for whatever reason you wish.
