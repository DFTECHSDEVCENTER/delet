							<h2>Discord Bot</h2>
							<p>
								The "delet" Discord bot (the "Bot"), with the Discord tag of "<strong>delet#5844</strong>", and no other Discord Bot account or Discord user account
								(a "Discord User") adheres to this privacy policy. Every use of a response-triggering Discord message (a "Command") is logged. These Command usage logs
								are not saved to a text file, or any other type of file. These Command usage logs are only visible to the Bot's owner, and the Bot's administrator. No
								other Discord User or Discord Bot has access to the Command usage logs. The Command usage logs contain small amounts of data regarding the use of Commands.
								These are: (1) the time at which the Command was run/activated, (2) the permission level of the Discord User running the Command, (3) the Discord tag
								(i.e. "DiscordUser#0001") of the Discord User running the Command, (4) the name of the Command. The arguments that the command was run with are not logged.
								Such data is collected for the purpose of debugging and allowing us to improve the overall user experience of the Bot. We do not share Command usage logs
								and information with any third-party organisations or persons.
							</p>

							<h2>Websites</h2>
							<p>
								<a href="https://delet.js.org/">delet.js.org</a>, (the "Website") is a subdomain of <a href="https://js.org/">js.org</a>,
								(the "Host"), which has its own privacy policy, stated here: <a href="https://js.org/privacy.html">https://js.org/privacy.html</a>.
								We (the "Company", "DS Development"), on this Website, do not collect any additional data or information of any sort in addition to what may already be
								collected by the Host. We may store small amounts of data within your browser, as cached content. Caching is activated by a Service Worker running in the
								background.
							</p>

							<p>
								<code>dashboard.url</code>, (the "Dashboard") is hosted privately, and is not hosted by the Website Host. We do not collect any personal or usage data/information on
								the Dashboard itself. Logins and other authentication forms are handled by Discord on both the frontend and backend. Therefore, Discord may collect data
								on these parts of the Dashboard, which are not controlled by DS Development. Using the "Add to Server" button anywhere on the Dashboard will also direct
								the User to a page controlled by Discord (the "Authorisation Page"). Data may be collected on this page by Discord themselves, however no login information
								is stored or collected by DS Development. Using the Authorisation Page allows the User to add delet (the "Bot") to any guild ("Server") they have the "Manage
								Server" permission on. Once the Bot joins a Server, DS Development collects minimal amounts of information about the Server. These are: (1) the Server's name,
								(2) the Server's ID, (3) the Server's member count.
